## What is a DCP?
 
A DCP is a collection of files that contains the digital version of your film, along with audio, subtitles, metadata, and encryption keys. A DCP is the standard format for delivering your film to cinemas around the world. A DCP can be either encrypted or unencrypted, depending on whether you want to protect your content from unauthorized copying or playback. An encrypted DCP requires a Key Delivery Message (KDM) to be generated and delivered to the cinema that will play your film[^3^].
