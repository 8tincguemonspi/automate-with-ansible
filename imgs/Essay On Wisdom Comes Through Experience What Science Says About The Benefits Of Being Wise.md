# Essay On Wisdom Comes Through Experience
 
Wisdom is the ability to make sound judgments and decisions based on knowledge, understanding, and insight. Wisdom is often considered as one of the most valuable qualities that a person can possess. But how does one acquire wisdom? Is it something that can be taught or learned? Or is it something that comes naturally with age and maturity? In this essay, I will argue that wisdom comes through experience, and that experience is the best teacher of wisdom.

## What is wisdom?
 
Before we can discuss how wisdom comes through experience, we need to define what wisdom is. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, wisdom is "the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment; the quality of being wise". However, this definition is rather vague and does not capture the essence of wisdom. A more comprehensive definition of wisdom is given by psychologist Robert Sternberg, who proposed a theory of wisdom as a form of intelligence. According to Sternberg, wisdom is "the application of intelligence toward the achievement of a common good through a balance among (a) intrapersonal, (b) interpersonal, and (c) extrapersonal interests, over the (a) short and (b) long terms, through the mediation of (a) positive and (b) negative emotions". In other words, wisdom is the ability to use one's cognitive and emotional skills to achieve goals that benefit oneself and others in various contexts and time frames.
 
## How does experience teach wisdom?
 
Now that we have a clear understanding of what wisdom is, we can explore how experience teaches wisdom. Experience is defined as "the process of doing and seeing things and of having things happen to you". Experience can be divided into two types: direct and indirect. Direct experience is when we personally encounter or participate in something, such as traveling to a new place, meeting new people, or facing a challenge. Indirect experience is when we learn from others' experiences, such as reading books, watching movies, or listening to stories. Both types of experience can contribute to our wisdom in different ways.
 
Direct experience teaches wisdom by exposing us to new situations and perspectives that challenge our existing beliefs and assumptions. For example, when we travel to a different culture, we may learn that our values and norms are not universal, but relative to our context. This may lead us to question our own biases and prejudices, and to appreciate diversity and tolerance. Similarly, when we face a difficult problem or a failure, we may learn that our knowledge and skills are not sufficient or infallible, but need to be improved or adapted. This may lead us to seek feedback and advice, and to embrace learning and growth.
 
Indirect experience teaches wisdom by providing us with vicarious lessons and insights that we may not have access to otherwise. For example, when we read a book or watch a movie, we may learn from the characters' actions and consequences, and apply them to our own lives. This may lead us to avoid mistakes or emulate successes that we have observed. Similarly, when we listen to a story or a testimony, we may learn from the emotions and values that are expressed by the narrator or the speaker. This may lead us to empathize with their feelings and perspectives, and to cultivate compassion and gratitude.
