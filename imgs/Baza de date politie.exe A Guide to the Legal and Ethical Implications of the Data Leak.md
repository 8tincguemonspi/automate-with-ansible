# What is Baza de date politie.exe and how to use it?
 
Baza de date politie.exe is a file that contains a database of personal information of people living in Bucharest, Romania. It was allegedly leaked by someone from the police or hacked by cybercriminals. The file can be downloaded from various online sources, but it may also modify the homepage of the browser or contain malware.
 
The file can be used to search for the name, address, phone number, ID number, and other details of any person by entering their CNP (personal identification number). However, the database is outdated and may not be accurate or complete. Moreover, using this file may be illegal or unethical, as it violates the privacy and security of the people whose data is exposed.

Therefore, it is not recommended to download or use Baza de date politie.exe for any purpose. Instead, one should rely on official sources of information or contact the authorities if they need to verify someone's identity or address. Baza de date politie.exe is a risky and unreliable file that may cause more harm than good.
  
Baza de date politie.exe is not the only file that contains sensitive data of Romanian citizens. There have been several cases of data breaches and leaks in the past, such as the exposure of the voter database in 2019, the hacking of the health insurance system in 2020, and the theft of personal data from a car rental company in 2021. These incidents have raised concerns about the security and privacy of personal data in Romania and the need for better protection and regulation.
 
According to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies to Romania as a member state, personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. This includes name, address, phone number, ID number, email address, bank account number, health records, biometric data, and more. The GDPR sets out the rights and obligations of data subjects (the people whose data is processed), data controllers (the entities that determine the purposes and means of processing data), and data processors (the entities that process data on behalf of controllers).
 
Some of the rights of data subjects under the GDPR are: the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, or object to the processing of their data; the right to data portability; the right to withdraw consent; and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. Some of the obligations of data controllers and processors under the GDPR are: to process data lawfully, fairly, and transparently; to collect data only for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; to ensure data accuracy and security; to notify data subjects and authorities of any data breaches; and to comply with requests from data subjects.
 
The GDPR also imposes fines and penalties for non-compliance or violations of data protection rules. Depending on the severity and nature of the infringement, the fines can range from 10 million euros or 2% of the annual worldwide turnover of the entity, whichever is higher, to 20 million euros or 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the entity, whichever is higher. In addition, data subjects can also seek compensation for any material or non-material damage suffered as a result of a breach or violation.
