The plot of Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice revolves around the conflict between the two titular heroes, who have different views on justice and morality. Batman, who has witnessed the death and destruction caused by Superman's battle with Zod in Metropolis, believes that Superman is a potential threat to humanity and must be stopped by any means necessary. Superman, who is trying to cope with his role as a hero and a symbol of hope, sees Batman as a violent vigilante who breaks the law and endangers innocent lives. The two heroes clash several times, unaware that they are being manipulated by Lex Luthor, a ruthless businessman who hates Superman and wants to destroy him.
 
Luthor obtains access to Zod's body and the Kryptonian scout ship, where he learns about the existence of other worlds and beings. He also acquires a large chunk of kryptonite, a radioactive mineral that can weaken and kill Superman. He uses the kryptonite to create a powerful spear and a suit of armor for himself. He also experiments on Zod's DNA and creates a monstrous creature called Doomsday, which he plans to unleash on Superman. Luthor also kidnaps Lois Lane, Superman's love interest and a reporter for the Daily Planet, and Martha Kent, Superman's adoptive mother. He blackmails Superman into fighting Batman by threatening to kill Martha if he does not comply.
 
Batman prepares for his confrontation with Superman by stealing the kryptonite from Luthor and building various weapons and gadgets. He also receives a mysterious message from an unknown source, warning him about an impending threat that will require him to unite with other metahumans (people with superpowers). One of these metahumans is Diana Prince, also known as Wonder Woman, an immortal Amazon warrior who has been living among humans for centuries. She has been tracking Luthor's activities and has discovered that he has stolen data about other metahumans, such as Aquaman, Flash, and Cyborg.
 
The final showdown between Batman and Superman takes place in an abandoned port in Gotham City. Batman uses his kryptonite weapons to gain an upper hand over Superman, but hesitates to kill him when he realizes that they both have mothers named Martha. At that moment, Lois arrives and explains that Luthor is behind everything. Batman decides to spare Superman and rescue Martha, while Superman confronts Luthor at the scout ship. There, Luthor unleashes Doomsday, a mindless killing machine that can adapt to any attack. Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman team up to fight Doomsday, but they are outmatched by its power and resilience. Superman realizes that the only way to stop Doomsday is to use the kryptonite spear, even though it will expose him to its lethal radiation. He sacrifices himself to stab Doomsday with the spear, while Doomsday impales him with one of its spikes. Both Superman and Doomsday die from their wounds.
